	abstract = {Gastrointestinal ({GI}) illness risks associated with exposure to waters impacted by human and nonhuman fecal sources were estimated using quantitative microbial risk assessment ({QMRA}). Microbial source tracking ({MST}) results had identiﬁed Escherichia coli (E. coli) contributors to the waterbody as human and unidentiﬁed (10\%), cattle and domestic animals (25\%), and wildlife (65\%) in a rural watershed. The illness risks associated with ingestion during recreation were calculated by assigning reference pathogens for each contributing source and using pathogen dose–response relationships. The risk of {GI} illness was calculated for a speciﬁc sampling site with a geometric mean of E. coli of 163 colony forming units (cfu) 100 {mL}−1, and the recreational standard of E. coli, 126 cfu 100 {mL}−1. While the most frequent sources of fecal indicator bacteria at the sampling site were nonhuman, the risk of illness from norovirus, the reference pathogen representing human waste, contributed the greatest risk to human health. This study serves as a preliminary review regarding the potential for incorporating results from library-dependent {MST} to inform a {QMRA} for recreational waters. The simulations indicated that identifying the sources contributing to the bacterial impairment is critical to estimate the human health risk associated with recreation in a waterbody.},

	abstract = {Total Maximum Daily Load ({TMDL}) stipulations remained unmet at a southern California beach despite a suite of management actions carried out since 2001, prompting exploration of a Natural Sources Exclusion ({NSE}) provision within the {TMDL}. Quantitative Microbial Source Tracking ({MST}) was employed from 2012 to 2015 to inventory sources of natural and anthropogenic fecal indicator bacteria ({FIB}). Data suggested {FIB} exceedances could be traced to gulls based on gull marker prevalence and correlations with {FIB} concentrations in seawater, sand, and eelgrass. In contrast, human marker concentrations and a tracer dye test did not indicate prevalent human sources. Exponential decay of gull marker in sand amended with live Catellicoccus marimammalium suggested that measured marker reﬂected fecal inputs versus growth outside the host. Improved water quality was coincident with a 2013 bird exclusion structure, consistent with {NSE}. However, load allocation needed for {TMDL} reconsideration was hampered by variable ratios of {FIB}, {MST} markers, and pathogens measured in seawater and in gull, cat, and raccoon feces. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment is a suggested path forward because such models can incorporate distributions from a combination of {FIB} sources and communicate criteria in terms of human health risk.},

A tiered probabilistic {TMDL} approach is proposed in this paper. A simple databased Tier I {TMDL} that uses statistical principles has been proposed for watersheds that have adequate water quality databases enabling statistical evaluations. Studies have shown that for many pollutants, event mean concentrations in runoff, wastewater loads, and concentrations in the receiving waters follow the log-normal probability distribution. Other probability distributions are also applicable. Tier {II} Monte Carlo simulation, using a simpler deterministic or black box water quality model as a transfer function, can then be used to generate time series of data, which ﬁlls the data gaps and allows estimation of probabilities of excursions of chronic standards that are averaged over periods of 4 or 30 days. Statistical approaches, including Monte Carlo, allow replacement of an arbitrary margin of safety by a quantitative estimation of uncertainty and enable linking the model results to the standards deﬁned in terms of magnitude, frequency, and duration.},

Previously published Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment ({QMRA}) methods were employed and extended to meet these objectives. Health outcomes used in the analyses were infection from reference waterborne pathogens via ingestion during recreation and subsequent gastrointestinal ({GI}) illness. Illness risks from these pathogens were calculated for exposure to faecally contaminated recreational water at the U.S. regulatory limits of 35 cfu 100 {mLÀ}1 enterococci and 126 cfu 100 {mLÀ}1 Escherichia coli. The probabilities of {GI} illness were calculated using pathogen dose-response relationships from the literature and Monte Carlo simulations. Three scenarios were simulated, representing a range of feasible interpretations of the available data. The primary ﬁndings are that: 1) {GI} illness risks associated with exposure to recreational waters impacted by fresh cattle faeces may not be substantially different from waters impacted by human sources; and 2) the risks associated with exposure to recreational waters impacted by fresh gull, chicken, or pig faeces appear substantially lower than waters impacted by human sources. These results suggest that careful consideration may be needed in the future for the management of recreational waters not impacted by human sources.},

	abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) to generalized cross-validation ({GCV}) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing {REML} or marginal likelihood ({ML}) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models ({GLMs}) use iterative {REML} or {ML} estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the {GLM}. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of {GCV}, or related criteria, for the {GLM} itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly deﬁned functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the ﬁrst such method for {REML} or {ML} estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate {REML} or {ML} for any {GLM}, which is suitable for efﬁcient direct optimization. This {REML} or {ML} criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for {GLM} ﬁtting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The {REML} or {ML} criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deﬁciency in the ﬁtted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new {REML} and {ML} methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to {GCV} or Akaike’s information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike’s information criterion and {GCV} are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as {GCV} or Akaike’s information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous {REML}- or {ML}-based approaches for penalized {GLMs} and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},
