A tiered probabilistic {TMDL} approach is proposed in this paper. A simple databased Tier I {TMDL} that uses statistical principles has been proposed for watersheds that have adequate water quality databases enabling statistical evaluations. Studies have shown that for many pollutants, event mean concentrations in runoff, wastewater loads, and concentrations in the receiving waters follow the log-normal probability distribution. Other probability distributions are also applicable. Tier {II} Monte Carlo simulation, using a simpler deterministic or black box water quality model as a transfer function, can then be used to generate time series of data, which ﬁlls the data gaps and allows estimation of probabilities of excursions of chronic standards that are averaged over periods of 4 or 30 days. Statistical approaches, including Monte Carlo, allow replacement of an arbitrary margin of safety by a quantitative estimation of uncertainty and enable linking the model results to the standards deﬁned in terms of magnitude, frequency, and duration.},

	abstract = {Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) to generalized cross-validation ({GCV}) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing {REML} or marginal likelihood ({ML}) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models ({GLMs}) use iterative {REML} or {ML} estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the {GLM}. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of {GCV}, or related criteria, for the {GLM} itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly deﬁned functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the ﬁrst such method for {REML} or {ML} estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate {REML} or {ML} for any {GLM}, which is suitable for efﬁcient direct optimization. This {REML} or {ML} criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for {GLM} ﬁtting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The {REML} or {ML} criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deﬁciency in the ﬁtted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new {REML} and {ML} methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to {GCV} or Akaike’s information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike’s information criterion and {GCV} are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as {GCV} or Akaike’s information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous {REML}- or {ML}-based approaches for penalized {GLMs} and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

	abstract = {It is known that serial correlation within time series at sites and cross-correlation among sites in a speciﬁc region will inﬂuence the ability of statistical tests to assess the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends over the region. However, serial and/or cross-correlation has been ignored in ﬁeld trend-analyses. This study attempts to develop a methodology that takes into account both serial and cross-correlation in the assessment of the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends. The regional average Mann–Kendall ({RAMK}) statistic is used to represent the regional properties of trends at a regional scale. The null distribution of the {RAMK} statistic is derived on the basis that the joint probability distribution of m independent normal variables is also normally distributed. The variance of the {RAMK} statistic is then modiﬁed by serial and cross-correlation. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by applying it to assess the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends in annual mean, annual maximum, and annual minimum daily streamﬂow from 1967 to 1996 in ten major homogeneous climate regions of Canada. The results indicate that the method developed provides more accurate assessment of the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends than that without consideration of serial and cross-correlation.},

	abstract = {In many hydrological studies, two non-parametric rank-based statistical tests, namely the Mann±Kendall test and Spearman's rho test are used for detecting monotonic trends in time series data. However, the power of these tests has not been well documented. This study investigates the power of the tests by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation results indicate that their power depends on the pre-assigned signi®cance level, magnitude of trend, sample size, and the amount of variation within a time series. That is, the bigger the absolute magnitude of trend, the more powerful are the tests; as the sample size increases, the tests become more powerful; and as the amount of variation increases within a time series, the power of the tests decrease. When a trend is present, the power is also dependent on the distribution type and skewness of the time series. The simulation results also demonstrate that these two tests have similar power in detecting a trend, to the point of being indistinguishable in practice.},
