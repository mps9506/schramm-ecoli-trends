# Monitoring for Progress: Water Quality Monitoring Considerations for Fecal Indicator Bacteria and TMDLs

General overview is to provide a snapshot of FIB montitoring characteristics of TMDL and non-TMDL streams. number of smaples, smaples per year, etc.

Identify the water quality characteristics (mean, sd, etc.) to generate synthetic datasets for detecting trends. How many samples per year should we be targeting to identify trends of various effect sizes.

Describe Methodology for incorporating flow in order to develop TMDLs and track progress in loads.
